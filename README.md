# Mastering Scene Understanding: Scene Graphs to the Rescue

The following is a demonstration of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) with Scene Graphs for the tutorial session of SIBGRAPI 2024

The code is an adaptation heavily based on the [official demo](https://github.com/fredzzhang/spatially-conditioned-graphs) for the paper:
> Zhang, Frederic Z., Dylan Campbell, and Stephen Gould. "Spatially conditioned graphs for detecting human-object interactions." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021.
